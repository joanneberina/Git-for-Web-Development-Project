5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
> All elements can be considered as boxes. You create layouts by putting boxes inside of other boxes. Sometimes it's hard to control the total width of a box because of padding and margins and borders. To set a width that includes these, you set the css property box-sizing: border-box; on all elements.
